## **Thermal Image Bounding Boxes**
currently working with the robotics team for our Coldtrailing & Hotspot-Detection Autonomous Robot..
I decided to experiment with opencv for bounding boxes arouund thermal images. 
I plan to change somethings later (I want to add a unsharp masking and prob'ly a cv.filter2D()).
